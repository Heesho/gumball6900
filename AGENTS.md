# Repository execution guide

This file governs automated contributors working in this repository. The protocol is not audited, deployed, or
authorized for user funds. A green local build is engineering evidence, never a release or deployment claim.

## Architectural boundaries

- `packages/contracts/src` is the single Solidity source tree shared by Foundry and Hardhat. Core contracts are
  direct, non-upgradeable deployments; do not add a public factory, generic executor, arbitrary vault call, NAV/price
  oracle, conventional DAO, or staking withdrawal lock.
- GBX lifetime minting is capped cumulatively at one billion. Redemption is an unpausable, pre-burn-total-supply,
  in-kind fraction of every registered raw vault balance. Never replace it with a NAV calculation.
- Normal acquisitions are bounded reverse Dutch auctions. The vault receives 98% and active managers for that asset
  receive 2%; zero-manager rewards return to the vault. Buyback accepts and actually burns GBX for USDG.
- Administrative work must remain within the typed timelock and exposure-only guardian boundaries documented in
  `docs/ACCESS_CONTROL.md`. CI must never broadcast mainnet transactions.

## Source and generated artifacts

- Edit Solidity under `packages/contracts/src`, then run Forge and Hardhat against the same source. Do not hand-edit
  compiler output under `artifacts`, `cache`, `out`, or `typechain-types`.
- SDK ABI files are generated from Foundry artifacts with `pnpm sdk:abi:generate`; verify with
  `pnpm sdk:abi:check`. Synchronize subgraph ABIs with `pnpm --filter @gumball-6900/subgraph abi:sync` after every
  relevant event or ABI change.
- Economic JSON fixtures and SVGs are committed reproducibility evidence. Change the independent models first, then
  regenerate and run `pnpm simulations:fixtures:check`; never patch expected numbers to hide a model mismatch.
- Files under `packages/config/deployments` are dated candidates or evidence unless a signed manifest explicitly
  clears every gate. Never invent an unresolved canonical address, signer, code hash, legal approval, or review.
- Raw audit output belongs in `packages/contracts/audit/reports` and is ignored. Reviewed dispositions belong in
  `packages/contracts/audit/FINDINGS.md`.

## Required checks

Run the narrow package checks while iterating, then the applicable repository gates before handoff:

```bash
pnpm format:check
pnpm lint
pnpm typecheck
pnpm build
pnpm test
pnpm sdk:abi:check
pnpm subgraph:build
pnpm web:test:e2e
```

Contract changes additionally require `forge fmt --check`, `forge build --sizes`, the configured Foundry suite, and
Hardhat tests. Event changes require subgraph codegen/build/Matchstick tests. Economic changes require both Python and
TypeScript models. Fork results count only when the exact RPC capability and block pin are recorded; a skipped fork is
not a pass.

## Safety and release language

- Never commit or print secrets, credential-bearing URLs, private keys, signer material, or private legal artifacts.
- Never deploy, verify live contracts, sign a manifest, transfer roles, fund genesis, publish packages, or release a
  public site unless the user explicitly authorizes that external action and all documented prerequisites are met.
- Preserve provisional, unresolved, demo, preview, and stale-state labels. Do not use “live,” “launched,” “audited,”
  “verified,” or “release-ready” unless the exact signed manifest and external evidence support the statement.
- Preserve user work in a dirty tree. Do not overwrite deployment state or rerun a partially broadcast Foundry phase;
  reconcile receipts and onchain state first.
- Any implementation/prose mismatch blocks production until it is resolved, tested, and recorded in an ADR when the
  protocol or trust model changes.
